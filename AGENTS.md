## Project

SpotFreeze is a tiny native Rust utility for Windows 11, Linux (Wayland), and
macOS 14+ (Apple Silicon) that freezes the screen on a global hotkey, then offers
spotlight / zoom / snip-to-clipboard modes. Single crate, one binary per
platform, no GUI framework, no runtime. See `README.md` for the product spec
and `plan.md` for the architecture rationale.

## Build & test

```bash
cargo build --release     # release binary → target/release/spotfreeze
cargo test                # full headless suite (safe on a live desktop)
cargo test --lib          # unit tests only
cargo test --test legend  # one integration scenario
cargo fmt                 # format
cargo clippy              # lint (treat warnings as errorsome — fix them)
```

Linux Docker equivalents (no local toolchain needed):

```bash
docker compose run test    # headless test suite
docker compose run build   # release binary into ./target/docker/
docker compose run dev     # interactive shell with cached cargo volumes
```

Platform-specific code is gated by `cfg(windows)` / `cfg(target_os = "linux")`
/ `cfg(target_os = "macos")`. On a non-Windows host, `cargo check` still type-
checks the portable core; cross-target checks use the per-OS CI runners.

## Architecture: pure core + platform seam

The single hard rule: **keep the pure core free of OS API types.**

- **Pure, headless-testable modules** (`geometry`, `settings`, `autostart`,
  `hotkeys::gesture`, `hotkeys::frozen`, `hotkeys::keymap`, `overlay::composite`,
  `overlay::events`, `overlay::legend`, `overlay::modes`, `overlay::controller`,
  `capture::png`, and the `capture::{DibBuffer, MonitorInfo, Capturer}` types)
  never expose `HWND`, Wayland, or AppKit objects in their public API. All their
  logic is integer pixel math / parsing / state transitions — deterministic and
  unit-tested.
- **Platform shells** (`hotkeys::manager`, `capture::gdi`, `overlay::window`,
  `ui`, `tray`, `app` on Windows; `platform/{windows,wayland,macos}/` backends)
  hold the OS bindings and talk to the core only through the seam.
- **The seam** lives in `src/platform/mod.rs`: the `OverlaySurface`,
  `SurfaceFactory`, and `PlatformServices` traits. The overlay controller is
  written against these traits, so a new platform is a new shell, not a fork of
  the core.

When adding a feature, ask: does this belong in the pure core (testable) or in
a platform shell (OS-specific)? Pure logic in the core, OS glue in the shell.

## Global contracts (binding for all implementers)

- **Pixel format**: `capture::DibBuffer` is 32-bit **BGRA**, 8 bits/channel,
  **non-premultiplied** alpha, **top-down** row order, tightly packed
  (`stride == width * 4`). Screen captures are always opaque (`A == 255`). All
  platforms share this format so captured pixels flow into overlays with no
  conversion.
- **Coordinates**: *virtual-screen* coords span the whole multi-monitor desktop
  (primary top-left is `(0, 0)`; other monitors may be **negative**).
  *Monitor-local* coords have `(0, 0)` at that monitor's top-left. Every
  function documents which space it uses. All units are **physical pixels**
  (the process is PerMonitorV2 DPI-aware; no DPI math inside the overlay path).
- **Error type**: fallible cross-module APIs return `anyhow::Result`. Pure
  parsers use their own typed errors (e.g. `hotkeys::gesture::ParseGestureError`).
- **No animations**: freeze/unfreeze and every in-session mode change are
  instant — no fades, no transitions, one repaint per change.

## Mode model (don't break these)

- **Spotlight** (`S`) cycles the spotlight shape (Circle → Diamond → Star → RoundedRect
  → Rectangle → off) and turns the layer off on the last shape; with every layer
  off the screen stays frozen but completely clear (no dim). Pressing `S` again
  brings the spotlight back at the starting shape (`spotlight.shape` setting,
  default Circle).
- **Zoom** is an **implicit layer** with no hotkey of its own: the
  zoom-modifier wheel chord (default `Shift`+wheel) zooms from any mode,
  stacking over spotlight on/off. The layer appears on zoom-in and
  auto-dismisses when the zoom returns to the minimum (1.0×); `0`
  (`reset_view`) drops it outright.
- **Capture** (`C`) **re-freezes**: the current view (spotlight/zoom baked in)
  becomes the new frozen frame and a drag-selection snips the *effected*
  pixels. `Ctrl+C` outside capture enters capture (same as `C`). `Esc` and
  `Ctrl+C` in capture copy the snip (or focused monitor) and unfreeze.
  `Esc` outside capture unfreezes.
- The **legend HUD** is painted into the composed frame only — never into the
  capture originals — so it can never leak into a snip copy or the capture
  re-base (`rebase_freeze` composes without it). Its text is anti-aliased
  vector typography from the embedded **Inter** typeface (SIL OFL 1.1,
  `assets/fonts/`), rasterized once per freeze by the pure-Rust `fontdue`
  crate into cached coverage bitmaps; `Legend::paint` only blits those caches
  (no font work on the per-frame repaint path). The HUD also draws a vector
  shape mark and keycap chrome in `paint`; that work stays integer pixel math.

## Settings

`spotfreeze.jsonc` (JSONC — comments and trailing commas allowed), written
atomically, in the per-OS config dir. Missing keys fall back to defaults;
malformed files never crash the app. Changes apply on the next freeze (or via
the tray *Reload settings*). The settings model (`settings/model.rs`) is the
single source of defaults; the store (`settings/store.rs`) only loads/saves.

## Conventions

- **Commits**: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, …). Releases are fully automated by
  release-please (`release-please-config.json`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
  release type `rust`): a `feat:`/`fix:` on `main` opens the release PR, bumps
  `Cargo.toml` + `CHANGELOG.md`, tags `v*`, and builds/attaches all three OS
  artifacts. `docs:`/`chore:` commits do not trigger a release.
- **Style**: match surrounding code. Module docs (`//!`) explain the contract
  at the top of each file; keep them accurate when you change behavior. Tests
  live inline (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) for unit tests and in `tests/` for
  end-to-end scenarios; both are headless and deterministic.
- **Tests first**: the pure core is fully unit-tested. When changing core
  logic, update/extend the inline tests and the `tests/` scenarios; run
  `cargo test` before finishing. Never commit a failing test.
- **No secrets / user content** in code, logs, or commits. The settings file
  is git-ignored; never check it in.

## Finishing a task

When a task is done and its changes are validated (build + `cargo test` +
`cargo clippy` pass), **commit and push everything — leave no change behind.**
The working tree must be clean when you finish. Stage and commit all modified
and new files, not just the ones directly tied to the task. Group them into
logical Conventional Commits (e.g. a `fix:`/`feat:` for the work, a `chore:`
for incidental tidy-ups, a `docs:` for doc-only changes) and push to the
current branch. A `feat:`/`fix:` on `main` triggers the release-please PR as
described above; `docs:`/`chore:` commits do not.

The only exception: do not commit unrelated changes that are clearly a
**regression** or something that is not supposed to be there (e.g. a stray
debug edit, a accidentally-reverted fix, build artifacts that should be
git-ignored). If you are unsure whether an unrelated change belongs, ask
before committing it. Otherwise, commit it.

An ordinary commit + push of finished, validated work is expected, not
optional. Still pause for explicit confirmation before genuinely
hard-to-reverse or destructive actions (force-pushes, history rewrites,
deleting untracked work).
