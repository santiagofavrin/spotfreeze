//! Layer-shell overlay surfaces: one fullscreen `zwlr_layer_surface_v1` per
//! output, presenting [`DibBuffer`] frames through double-buffered wl_shm
//! slots.
//!
//! # Contracts
//!
//! - **Surface**: layer `OVERLAY`, namespace `spotfreeze`, anchored to all
//!   four edges, `exclusive_zone = -1` (cover the output exactly, ignore
//!   struts), `keyboard_interactivity = EXCLUSIVE` — the frozen overlay must
//!   receive every key. If the compositor never grants focus, the shell
//!   demotes the surface to `ON_DEMAND` after the freeze (see
//!   [`super::shell::Shell::ensure_keyboard_focus`]).
//! - **Sizing**: the buffer is the output's PHYSICAL pixel size; the surface
//!   is logical-size driven (4 anchors, size 0) with
//!   `wl_surface.set_buffer_scale(scale)` — physical = logical × scale
//!   (integer scales only, see the shell module docs). The initial commit is
//!   buffer-less; the factory waits (bounded) for the first `configure` and
//!   acks it before the first present, per the layer-shell handshake.
//! - **Presentation**: [`OverlaySurface::present`] memcpy's the full frame or
//!   only the dirty rows into the BACK slot's shm mapping (same tightly
//!   packed BGRA layout as [`DibBuffer`], so `wl_shm::Format::Xrgb8888` on
//!   little-endian needs no conversion), then `damage_buffer` + `attach` +
//!   `commit` + connection flush. INVARIANT: every attached slot holds the
//!   COMPLETE latest frame — `damage_buffer` only claims the diff against
//!   the previously presented frame, so a partially-written buffer shows its
//!   stale/zero regions on compositors that import per-buffer textures
//!   (Hyprland: black screen outside the dirty rect, "painted" back by
//!   cursor movement). Dirty presents therefore mirror their copy into the
//!   other slot when it is writable; a slot that misses an update goes STALE
//!   and is healed with a full copy the next time it is picked (see
//!   [`plan_writes`]).
//! - **Double buffering**: a slot is writable only after the compositor's
//!   `wl_buffer.release`. Releases arrive on a DEDICATED event queue per
//!   surface (pumped non-blocking inside `present`/`can_present`, which also
//!   read the connection themselves, keeping releases flowing even when the
//!   caller drives presents in a burst; events
//!   for the main queue stay buffered for it). `present` NEVER blocks: with
//!   both slots busy it drops the frame — the controller defers through
//!   [`OverlaySurface::can_present`] and repaints with the latest composed
//!   frame once a slot frees (high-rate pointer input would otherwise build
//!   an unbounded repaint backlog behind the compositor's release cadence).
//! - **Teardown**: `Drop` unregisters the surface from the input registry and
//!   the shell's focus list, then destroys the layer surface + wl_surface +
//!   buffers (proxy destructors).
//!
//! The translatable pieces — dirty-rect clipping, row copying, slot
//! selection — are pure and unit-tested headless; only the protocol glue
//! touches Wayland objects.
