//! PURE pixel operations on [`DibBuffer`] — the performance-critical core.
//!
//! No `windows` types anywhere: every function works on plain buffers and
//! geometry and is exhaustively unit-tested headless. Coordinates are
//! BUFFER-LOCAL physical pixels unless a function explicitly says
//! virtual-screen.
//!
//! The render pipeline for one monitor's frame is [`compose_frame`], fed with
//! a [`RenderState`] built by the mode stack (composable layers):
//! **zoom base → colored darken → spotlight hole (reveals the ZOOMED base) →
//! snip selection (interior + border ring) → capture-mode indicator frame**.
