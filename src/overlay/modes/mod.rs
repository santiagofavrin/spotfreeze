//! Overlay modes (Spotlight on/off, Capture, and the zoom LAYER) plus
//! the [`ModeStack`] that combines them. Every layer is a pure state machine —
//! pixel compositing lives in [`crate::overlay::composite::compose_frame`];
//! a layer only tracks state (cursor, radius, zoom factor, selection) and
//! reports dirty regions. No `windows` types anywhere in this module tree.
//!
//! # Mode model (product spec)
//!
//! - **Spotlight toggle (`S`) → [`ModeStack::toggle_mode`]**: the layer is
//!   added when inactive (fresh state at the settings default shape). When
//!   active, pressing `S` advances the shape (Circle → Diamond → RoundedRect → Rectangle);
//!   pressing `S` on the LAST shape (`RoundedRect`) REMOVES the layer.
//!   Toggling the last layer off leaves the screen frozen but UNVEILED
//!   ([`ModeStack::any_active`] is false — the controller dims nothing).
//!   Spotlight is the default mode: freeze starts with the layer on.
//! - **Capture (`C`) → [`ModeStack::set_mode`]`(ModeKind::Snip)` →
//!   [`ModeStack::enter_capture`]**: the controller RE-BASES the freeze on the
//!   currently composited view (the spotlight/zoom effects active at that
//!   moment baked in); the stack STASHES the spotlight/zoom layers and
//!   activates a fresh snip layer for the drag-selection. Esc →
//!   [`ModeStack::exit_capture`]: the stashed layers come back exactly as
//!   they were (spotlight on/off state, zoom factor/focus) and the snip layer
//!   is dropped; the controller restores the pre-capture base.
//! - **Zoom (the zoom-modifier wheel chord from anywhere) → an IMPLICIT
//!   effect LAYER, not a mode, with no hotkey of its own**: the chord
//!   (default Shift+wheel) zooms from ANY state, IMPLICITLY ACTIVATING the
//!   layer at the last-used factor ([`ModeStack::last_zoom`]) when it isn't
//!   active yet. The layer exists only while actually magnified: zooming back
//!   to the configured minimum ([`ModeParams::zoom_min`], default 1.0)
//!   AUTO-DISMISSES it (banking the minimum as the last-used factor), and `0`
//!   ([`ModeStack::reset_view`]) drops it outright.
//! - **Wheel routing** ([`ModeStack::on_wheel`]):
//!   * the PLAIN wheel (no modifiers held) resizes the spotlight while its
//!     layer is active — wheel up makes it smaller, wheel down makes it
//!     bigger; no modifier is needed; the layer keeps the sub-notch
//!     accumulator. The plain wheel NEVER zooms;
//!   * the configured zoom-modifier chord (default Shift+wheel) zooms from ANY
//!     state — IMPLICITLY ACTIVATING the zoom layer at the last-used factor
//!     (additive, no transition animation) when it isn't active yet, and
//!     AUTO-DISMISSING it when the zoom returns to the minimum;
//!   * a chord matching several routes (possible only via a hand-edited empty
//!     zoom modifier) reaches every matching layer; their effects merge.
//! - **Mouse move** feeds every active cursor-tracking layer (spotlight hole
//!   follows, zoom focus recenters, an in-progress snip drag extends).
//! - **Left drag** feeds the snip layer when active.
//! - **Rendering**: the controller asks [`ModeStack::render_state`] for the
//!   per-monitor [`crate::overlay::composite::RenderState`] and hands it to
//!   `compose_frame` — layers never touch pixels themselves.
