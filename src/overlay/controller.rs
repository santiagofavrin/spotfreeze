//! Overlay orchestration: freeze/unfreeze, COMPOSABLE mode layers, event
//! routing, the mode legend, clipboard copy.
//! Platform-agnostic shell around the PURE [`ModeStack`] and
//! [`crate::overlay::composite`] pixel ops; the per-OS pieces (surfaces,
//! cursor, clipboard) go through the [`crate::platform`] seam.
//!
//! Implementation notes (contract clarifications — public API kept):
//! - **Default mode**: `freeze` enters Spotlight (product spec default).
//! - **Mode model**: Spotlight cycles shapes (Circle → Diamond → RoundedRect → Rectangle)
//!   then turns off on the last shape — with every layer off the screen stays
//!   frozen but UNVEILED. Zoom is an IMPLICIT effect LAYER driven only by the
//!   zoom-modifier wheel chord (default Shift+wheel) — activated on zoom-in,
//!   auto-dismissed back at the 1.0 baseline, and dropped outright by the
//!   reset-view hotkey. Capture (`C`) RE-BASES the freeze (see below). Every
//!   key-driven mode change is SEAMLESS: no flash frames, no border rings.
//!   Spotlight toggles and full mode switches repaint once, instantly.
//! - **No transitions**: freeze and unfreeze are INSTANT. Freeze presents
//!   each monitor's settled frame once — veil at full strength, spotlight
//!   circle at its settled radius, legend at full strength; unfreeze simply
//!   destroys the overlay windows. There are no fades or animations anywhere
//!   in the controller: every key-driven change (mode switches, spotlight
//!   toggles, capture entry/exit) repaints once, immediately.
//! - **Capture re-freeze**: entering capture mode composes every monitor's
//!   CURRENT view (zoom base → veil → spotlight hole — WITHOUT the mode
//!   legend) and swaps it in as the new ORIGINAL, stashing the pre-capture
//!   originals ([`rebase_freeze`]). The snip selection and the clipboard
//!   copy then operate on the EFFECTED pixels (WYSIWYG), and the frame gains
//!   the persistent accent capture indicator
//!   ([`crate::overlay::composite::compose_frame`] step 5). Capture mode has
//!   its own veil: the lighter, cooler snip veil (`overlay.snip_dim_opacity`
//!   / `overlay.snip_color`) replaces the spotlight veil, and the drawn
//!   rectangle stays COMPLETELY CLEAR (the un-dimmed base) behind a crisp
//!   two-tone border. Esc in capture mode exits back to the pre-capture
//!   view with the stashed spotlight/zoom state restored ([`exit_capture`]);
//!   Esc outside capture mode unfreezes.
//! - **Rendering**: every repaint composes the full frame via
//!   [`crate::overlay::composite::compose_frame`] with a
//!   [`crate::overlay::composite::RenderState`] built from the active layers
//!   ([`ModeStack::render_state`]) into the persistent per-monitor frame
//!   buffer — no per-frame allocations in the render path — then paints the
//!   mode legend ([`crate::overlay::legend`]) on top: a large translucent
//!   pill near the top-center listing the modes as tabs (active ones
//!   highlighted) with their freeze-time hotkey bindings. The legend never
//!   reaches the capture originals: `rebase_freeze` composes without it, so
//!   snip copies stay clean. The pill is MOVABLE (drag it anywhere on its
//!   monitor) and CLOSEABLE (click its "×" button to hide it for the rest of
//!   the freeze session); both are per-monitor, per-session, and the position
//!   survives capture entry/exit. The `overlay.show_legend` setting gates
//!   whether the pill appears at all. Legend drag/close events are intercepted
//!   BEFORE mode routing so the spotlight/zoom don't follow the cursor while
//!   the pill is being dragged.
//! - **Cursor seeding**: freshly activated layers receive one synthetic
//!   mouse-move with the LIVE cursor position, so the first presented frame
//!   already has the spotlight hole / zoom focus under the cursor instead of
//!   at `(0, 0)`.
//! - **Focused screen**: "monitor under the cursor" (the no-selection copy
//!   fallback) means the monitor whose virtual-screen bounds contain the live
//!   cursor position; falls back to monitor 0 when the cursor is outside every
//!   monitor (transient display-change states) so Ctrl+C always copies
//!   something.
//! - **Per-monitor selections**: snip drags are MONITOR-LOCAL and clamped at
//!   monitor edges by the layer; a selection never spans monitors. The copy
//!   path crops from that monitor's current base — in capture mode the
//!   re-frozen (effected) frame, otherwise the zoomed view when the zoom
//!   layer is active on it, else the original capture (WYSIWYG).
//! - **Keys**: modes never see key events — Esc / Ctrl+C / mode switches /
//!   reset-view are handled by the platform shell (global hotkeys on Windows,
//!   overlay key events matched against the frozen plan elsewhere), so the
//!   `KeyDown` arm of the event path is deliberately inert.
