//! PURE mode/hotkey legend: while frozen, a modern translucent rounded pill
//! near the top-center of every monitor shows the modes as TABS — the active
//! one(s) highlighted — each labelled with the hotkey that reaches it
//! (bindings snapshotted from settings at freeze time, like every other
//! freeze-time setting) — followed by the app version label and a close
//! ("×") button.
//!
//! The pill is MOVABLE: the user can grab it anywhere and drag it to a new
//! position on that monitor (the position is per-monitor and per-freeze-
//! session, starting at the default top-center spot). The close button at the
//! pill's right end hides it for the rest of the freeze session (it reappears
//! on the next freeze). The `overlay.show_legend` setting controls whether
//! the pill appears at all. The controller (not this module) owns the
//! position/hidden/drag state; [`Legend::paint`] simply draws at the origin
//! it is given.
//!
//! The pill sits below the top edge with a generous inset so it stays visible
//! without looking pinned to the screen boundary. It is painted into the
//! composed frame only — never into the capture originals — so it can never
//! leak into a snip copy or the capture-mode re-base.
//!
//! Text is rendered with the embedded **Inter** typeface (SIL Open Font
//! License 1.1, see `assets/fonts/OFL.txt`), rasterized to per-pixel alpha
//! coverage at construction time by the pure-Rust [`fontdue`] crate — no OS
//! text APIs, fully headless-testable. Glyphs are pre-rasterized once per
//! freeze (in [`Legend::build`]) into cached coverage bitmaps, so [`Legend::paint`]
//! only blits cached coverage with the shared integer alpha-blend math: no
//! font work happens on the per-frame repaint path. Everything here is
//! deterministic pixel math.
//!
//! Design language: a macOS-Control-Center-style "glass" capsule — a
//! translucent near-black rounded pill, the active mode drawn in a brighter
//! translucent white chip with near-white text, inactive modes in a cool
//! secondary gray, and a dimmer trailing version label. No animations
//! (project rule): the pill appears at full strength from the first frame.
